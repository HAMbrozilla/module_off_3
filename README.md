============

Submission for the third Module Off - EntityFieldQuery.

This repository contains the module and info files for the video_game_queries module. This module is an example module that demonstrates simple methods and OOP capabilities (object extension) of Drupal 7's EntityFieldQuery class. I created it for the Module Off with two purposes: to learn about this class myself and to educate others. I hope you enjoy learning about it as much as I did, and continue to delve into the powerful EFQ class.
